#Variables
lHost = "" # This is the Server's IP
# lHost is the Variable, where you have to put in your own IP. If you test the whole RAT on the same Computer (Server and Client running there) then you have to just leave the field blank.

port = 80  # This is the Connection Port
# -Port is again the Variable where you can change the connection port (Both Ports have to be the same in Server Code and Client Code)

# Test is the first added "feature" of this RAT. 
# It sends only a response to the Server saying that it's working. 
# Here is the place to add features for yourself, like a shutdown, dowload or even a shell. 
# Be creative and try different ideas.
